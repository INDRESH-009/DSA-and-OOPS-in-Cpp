This is the notes for OOPS and basics of C++

Layers of software technology

    Topic 01 - Software evolution : 
machine language -> assembly language -> procedural programming -> object-oriented programming

1. Machine language consist of binary code(0 and 1) which is hardware dependent 
2. Assembly language was built to replace the binary code with symbols and mnemonics that instructs the computer to do a specific task. This improved the efficiency of the programmers. But assembly language code was still hardware dependent.
3. High level languages like c,c++ and java were then developed to increase the programmers efficiecy and manily focus on solving the problem rather than worring about the hardware being used.

    Topic 02 - Process of translation to machine code
Although development for programmers efficieny took place computer was always designed to understand binary. So code written in assembly or high level language had to be translated to machine code to be understood by the computer

Program written in high level language -> Source program 
Equivalent machine level program -> object program
Process to convert from source code to machine code can be done in 2 ways
    1. Compilation
    2. Interpretation
